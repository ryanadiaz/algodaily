    <!-- 
      You're given an array of stock prices, with each element being an integer that represents a price. Each index thus represents a day, and the the element in that index is the stock price for that given day. 
      
      Given the ability to only buy once and sell once, our goal is to maximize the amount of profit (purchase price - selling price) that we can attain and return that value. Note: we cannot sell a stock before we buy one.

      E.g., stockOptimizer([ 10, 7, 6, 2, 9, 4 ])  Answer = 7, because we must buy on "2" and sell on "9" which gives a max profit of 7.
      E.g., stockOptimizer([9, 8, 6, 5, 3]) Answer = 0, we cannot generate a profit here because we must buy first, and then the price drops every day.
